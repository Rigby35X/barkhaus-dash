## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm i @grapesjs/studio-sdk
```

## 🏗 Quick Start

Here’s how easy it is to embed Studio SDK in your React application:

```jsx
import StudioEditor from '@grapesjs/studio-sdk/react';
import '@grapesjs/studio-sdk/style';

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <StudioEditor
      options={{
        // ...
        // Any license key is valid from localhost, you can play with locally with no restrictions
        licenseKey: 'DEV_LICENSE_KEY',
        project: {
          type: 'web',
          // The default project to use for new projects
          default: { pages: [{ name: 'Home', component: '<h1>Home page</h1>' }] },
        }
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

You can use the same initialization pattern in other JavaScript frameworks.

```js
import createStudioEditor from '@grapesjs/studio-sdk';
import '@grapesjs/studio-sdk/style';

// ...
createStudioEditor({
  // ...
  root: '#studio', // indicate where to mount the editor
  licenseKey: 'DEV_LICENSE_KEY',
  project: {
    type: 'web',
    default: { pages: [{ name: 'Home', component: '<h1>Home page</h1>' }] },
  }
})
```

You now have a fully functional no-code builder.
